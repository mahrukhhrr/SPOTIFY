This project analyzes Spotify music data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about songs, artists, and listening behavior. It uses Python for data wrangling, statistical analysis, and visualization.

üîë Key Features

Data Collection:

Use Spotify‚Äôs Web API via the spotipy library.

Extract track, artist, and playlist metadata (e.g., popularity, danceability, energy, tempo).

Import pre-downloaded datasets (CSV/JSON).

Data Cleaning & Processing:

Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.

Convert duration, tempo, and key into meaningful formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of features (tempo, loudness, energy, danceability).

Correlation between features (e.g., danceability vs. popularity).

Top artists, genres, and tracks by popularity.

Trends in music features over years.

Visualization:

Bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots (matplotlib, seaborn).

Interactive charts (plotly).

Word clouds for genres and artists.

Advanced Analytics (Optional):

Build recommendation system using cosine similarity (content-based).

Predict track popularity using machine learning models (scikit-learn).

Cluster songs with K-Means based on audio features.

Output:

Summary reports (CSV/Excel/PDF).

Interactive dashboards (Streamlit or Dash).

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn, spotipy

APIs: Spotify Web API
